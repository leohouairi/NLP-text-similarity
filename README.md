## Acknowledgments

* We forked https://github.com/PierreColombo/nlg_eval_via_simi_measures to fix an issue with our use of InfoLM with GPU (.to(device) missing in a particular case), but all the computation methods are unmodified from the initial project.
* We copypaste the BartScorer class in our notebook from https://github.com/neulab/BARTScore since they did not provide a clear way of installing their package.
* All kudos belong to them
